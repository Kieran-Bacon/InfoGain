OVERVIEW
========

Our automatic annotator identifies pairs of entities and a trigger of the relation between them. 
It does so by first trying to link all entities to Wikipedia (and consequently to Freebase, since 
Freebase is linked to Wikipedia). Given two entities appearing within 10 tokens of each other in 
a sentence, our annotator checks whether there is a relation connecting them in Freebase. If such 
a relation exists, the annotator looks for a trigger in the sentence. A trigger must be a synonym 
for the Freebase relation (according to WordNet) and its distance to the nearest entity cannot be 
more than 5 tokens.

We applied this method for the New York Times and were able to annotate over 60,000 sentences 
with 13,000 distinct entity pairs. For our experiments, we randomly selected one sentence for 
each entity pair and separated a thousand for development and 12,000 for test. 

An extraction is deemed correct if it contains the trigger.

RUNNING THE SCRIPT
==================

Syntax: perl binary-automatic-evaluation.pl ground-truth system-output


FILE FORMAT - GROUND TRUTH
==========================

The ground truth files contain 5 fields separated by tab. A header is required.

 - Entity1:				The first Freebase entity

 - Relation:			The relation id from Freebase.

 - Entity2:				The second Freebase entity

 - Relational Word: 	The relation trigger, that is, a relation synonym found in the sentence.

 - Annotated Sentence: 	The sentence annotated with the entity pair and the trigger.
						Entities are enclosed in triple square brackets and triggers are enclosed 
						in triple curly brackets.
					
						
FILE FORMAT - SYSTEM OUTPUT
===========================

The system output files are only required to contain 3 fields. A header is required.

 - Entity1:				The first entity

 - Relation:			The extracted relation. Systems must output three dashes ("---") to denote 
						no relation.

 - Entity2:				The second entity

In our system output files, we included a 4th field containing the annotated sentence from 
the ground truth. This field is used for manual analysis only and is not used by the evaluation 
script.

The entity pair in each line of the system output must match the entity pair in its respective line
of the ground truth. The evaluation script will raise an error if this condition is not met.


REPRODUCING THIS EXPERIMENT
===========================

In order to reproduce this experiment with other corpora, we are sharing the Freebase relations we use
and their respective synonyms (as extracted from WordNet). 

This information can be found in the file: "relation_synonyms.txt". Each line in this file contains one
Freebase relation and its synonyms. Fields are separated by tab. The first field corresponds to the 
Freebase relation key and the following fields are synonyms.
