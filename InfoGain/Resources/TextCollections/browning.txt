the jury further said in term-end presentments that the city executive committee which had over-all charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted.
the september-october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hard-fought primary which was won by mayor-nominate ivan allen jr.
only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city.
the jury said it did find that many of georgia registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous.
it recommended that fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them.
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments.
merger proposed.
however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration.
the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies.
it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem.
implementation of georgia automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury.
it urged that the next legislature provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected.
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare department handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes.
this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money.
the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties.
nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said.
failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers.
the jury also commented on the fulton ordinary court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation.
wards protected.
the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee.
these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said.
regarding atlanta new multi-million-dollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge jan the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences.
the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable.
ask jail deputies.
on other matters the jury recommended that.
four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail.
.
fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes.
the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department the fulton tax commissioner office the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms grady hospital and the fulton health department.

georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the governor race a top official said wednesday.
robert snodgrass state gop chairman said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience.
state party chairman james w dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept in savannah at which newly elected texas sen john tower will be the featured speaker.
in the blue ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters.
despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to republicans who attended.
when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no -- and there were no dissents.
the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken.
five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot or.
the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform.

the georgia legislature will wind up its session monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly.
before adjournment monday afternoon the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made.
gov vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment.
vandiver likely will mention the million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item.
construction bonds.
meanwhile it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first million worth of highway reconstruction bonds.
the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgia most heavily traveled highways.
a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some million to million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work.
a revolving fund.
the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities.
vandiver opened his race for governor in with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov marvin griffin.
the highway department source told the constitution however that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds.
schley county rep b d pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the body action of friday in voting itself a per day increase in expense allowances.
pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the quickie vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought.
while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through -.
a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of -.
as of sunday night there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action.

but he added that none of georgia congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution.
the resolution which barber tossed into the house hopper friday will be formally read monday.
it says that in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds the state board of education should be directed to give priority to teacher pay raises.
colquitt.
-- after a long hot controversy miller county has a new school superintendent elected as a policeman put it in the coolest election i ever saw in this county.
the new school superintendent is harry davis a veteran agriculture teacher who defeated felix bush a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee.
davis received votes in saturday election and bush got.
ordinary carey williams armed with a pistol stood by at the polls to insure order.
this was the coolest calmest election i ever saw colquitt policeman tom williams said.
being at the polls was just like being at church.
i did not smell a drop of liquor and we did not have a bit of trouble.
the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet however.
it was marked by controversy anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence.
the former county school superintendent george p callan shot himself to death march four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.
during the election campaign both candidates davis and bush reportedly received anonymous telephone calls.
ordinary williams said he too was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election.
many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election.

everything went real smooth the sheriff said.
there was not a bit of trouble.
austin texas.
-- committee approval of gov price daniel abandoned property act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers.
daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation.
under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week.
but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.
daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug.
he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since texas was a republic.
it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more.
the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer.
the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property daniel declared.
dewey lawrence a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers.
if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said.
you take out of circulation many millions of dollars.
rep charles e hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies.
his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor b jones of houston j b brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin.
cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts.
he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last monday.
austin texas.
-- senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties.
the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state.
there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house.
it would authorize the texas education agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of or more population require deaf children between and years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here.
operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas harris bexar tarrant and el paso would be which would be a savings of yearly after the first year capital outlay of was absorbed parkhouse told the senate.
the tea estimated there would be scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school.
dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps v e red berry and joe ratcliff.
while details are still to be worked out ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berry proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected.
we re getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting said ratcliff.
but i believe if people were better informed on this question most of them would oppose it also.
i m willing to stake my political career on it.
rep berry an ex-gambler from san antonio got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies.
a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report although the resolution faces hard sledding later.
the house passed finally and sent to the senate a bill extending the state health department authority to give planning assistance to cities.
the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees passing the three on the calendar.
one validated acts of school districts.
another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district.
the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted.
without dissent senators passed a bill by sen a r schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district.
money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site.
two tax revision bills were passed.
one by sen louis crump of san saba would aid more than retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized.
instead retailers would sign a certificate of correctness violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison plus a fine.
it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league.
the other bill by sen a m aikin jr of paris would relieve real estate brokers who pay their own annual licensing fee from the annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds.
natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain under a bill by sen frank owen of el paso to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas.
marshall formby of plainview former chairman of the texas highway commission suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the legislature and congress eliminating the need for costly special elections.
under formby plan an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor lieutenant governor speaker of the house attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court.
austin texas.
-- state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay.
an adverse vote of to kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april ballot when texas votes on a u s senator.
rep wesley roberts of seminole sponsor of the poll idea said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill.
the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb.
the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval by two-thirds majorities before march to be printed on the april ballot roberts said.
opponents generally argued that the ballot could not give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice.
all dallas members voted with roberts except rep bill jones who was absent.
austin texas.
-- paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas big cities thursday.
rep james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise a wise county hamlet of people.
when the shouting ended the bill passed to sending it to the senate where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen george parkhouse of dallas.
most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen parkhouse.
the bill would increase from to the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project.
cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas.
statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill did not sway cotten attack.
the bill defenders were mostly small-town legislators like j w buchanan of dumas eligio kika de la garza of mission sam f collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs.
this is a poor boy bill said chapman.
dallas and fort worth can vote bonds.
this would help the little peanut districts.
austin texas.
-- a houston teacher now serving in the legislature proposed thursday a law reducing the time spent learning educational methods.
rep henry c grover who teaches history in the houston public schools would reduce from to semester hours the so-called teaching methods courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate.
a normal year work in college is semester hours.
grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching.
the remainder of the -year college requirement would be in general subjects.
a person with a master degree in physics chemistry math or english yet who has not taken education courses is not permitted to teach in the public schools said grover.
college teachers in texas are not required to have the education courses.
fifty-three of the representatives immediately joined grover as co-signers of the proposal.

state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a blue ribbon citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program.
the report culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm listed long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load.
the report called racial discrimination in employment one of the most serious causes of family breakdown desertion and adc dependency.
must solve problem.
the monthly cost of adc to more than recipients in the county is million dollars said c virgil martin president of carson pirie scott co committee chairman.
we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence martin said.
the volume of adc cases will decrease martin reported when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color.
these he said are two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc.
calls for extension.
other recommendations made by the committee are.
extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives including both parents as a means of preserving family unity.
research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy.
several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest judge james b parsons was told in criminal court yesterday.
the disclosure by charles bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial.
bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client alan clements a separate trial.
bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom.
fears prejudicial aspects.
the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client bellows told the court.
some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property.
it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others.
judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this.
yes your honor replied bellows.
what this amounts to if true is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case.
there is a conflict among the defendants.
washington july.
-- president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio.
the president spent much of the week-end at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone.
shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port mass a white house spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion.
decisions are made.
asked to elaborate pierre salinger white house press secretary replied i would say it got to go thru several more drafts.
salinger said the work president kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russia demands and proposals for the city.
the last cases in the investigation of the nov election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means.
karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the persons.
he said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens.
karns ruling pertained to eight of the cases.
in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case.
contempt proceedings originally had been brought against persons in precincts by morris j wexler special prosecutor.
issue jury subpoenas.
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury.
mayer goldberg attorney for election judges in the th precinct of the d ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation.
wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning.
karns said it was a wrongful act for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room.
he said this constituted a very serious misuse of the criminal court processes.
actually the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east st louis sitting in cook county court.
faced seven cases.
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving persons.
wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another.
the cases involved judges in the d th and d precincts of the st ward the st and th precincts of the th ward the th precinct of the th ward and the th precinct of the d ward.
the case of the judges in the th precinct of the d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns.
two other cases also were under advisement.
claims precedent lacking.
after reading his statement discharging the d ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them.
washington feb.
-- president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of million americans over who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs.
the president in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build new medical and new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research.
the aged care plan similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a fight on capitol hill.
it was defeated in congress last year.
cost up to a year.
it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes.
the social security payroll tax is now per cent -- per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first of pay per year.
the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to a year and the payroll tax to per cent -- per cent each.
similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system.
the payroll tax would actually rise to per cent starting jan if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs.
outlays would increase.
officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run billion or more in the first year.
both figures would go higher in later years.
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of million to billion dollars over the next years.
these would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes.
nursing home care.
the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems.
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to days for each illness except that the patient would pay a day of the cost for the first nine days.
.
full payment of nursing home bills for up to days following discharge from a hospital.
a patient could receive up to days paid-for nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit.
.
hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of a patient.
.
community visiting nurse services at home for up to days an illness.
the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged.
calls proposal modest.
he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay.
this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.
this is not a program of socialized medicine.
it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed.
every person will choose his own doctor and hospital.
would not pay doctors.
the plan does not cover doctor bills.
they would still be paid by the patient.
apart from the aged care plan the president most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.
the president said the nation medical and dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care.
moreover he said many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they ca not afford the schooling costs.
contributions to schools.
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to a year for one-fourth of the first year students.
the schools could use the money to pay -year scholarships based on need of up to a year per student.
in addition the government would pay a cost of education grant to the schools for each in scholarship grants.
officials estimated the combined programs would cost million dollars the first year and would go up to millions by.
the president recommended federal matching grants totaling million dollars in years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones.
more for nursing homes.
in the area of community health services the president called for doubling the present million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction.
he asked for another million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes.
he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.
in the child health field the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children bureau.
he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute.
asks research funds.
the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.
he did not say by how much.
for medical research he asked a million dollar a year increase from to millions in matching grants for building research facilities.
the president said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the million dollars in the - budget for direct government research in medicine.
the president said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them.
reaction as expected.
congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines.
legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the president plan.
those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.
senate republican leader dirksen ill and house republican leader charles halleck ind said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance.
halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first.
house speaker sam rayburn d tex called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction on its fate in the house.
washington feb.
-- acting hastily under white house pressure the senate tonight confirmed robert c weaver as the nation federal housing chief.
only senators were on the floor and there was no record vote.
a number of scattered ayes and noes was heard.
customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency.
in the last eight years all presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a hour delay after they are reported to the floor.
enforce by demand.
the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse d ore in connection with president eisenhower cabinet selections in and president kennedy in.
oslo.
the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings.
this has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes.
in oslo the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another problems.
this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems.
the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been conspicuous by its absence.
explosion avoided.
in the case of portugal which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension.
the general remarkably courteous explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been no explosion in the council.
there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members votes since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance.
canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive.
even norway despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance is today closer to the nato line.
on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for.
one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusk speeches as inconclusive.
but he hastened to add that if united states policies were not always clear despite mr rusk analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy.
exploratory mood.
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited.
the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite mr rusk personal popularity that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots.
the secretary of state himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months.
but where the core of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at nato disposal in european waters.
the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole.
conflict surveyed.
the secretary greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that east-west friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection.
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when ratified as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.
this increase in the threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the alliance most difficult problems in the months to come.
each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down but never completely fulfilled.
washington.
the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time.
there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos.
the united states state department officials explain now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam.
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this.
the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated.
but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility.
policies modified.
the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference.
this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make.
it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration.
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.
but with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises.
how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression.
former vice-president richard m nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union.
he was critical of what he feels is president kennedy tendency to be too conciliatory.
gop restrained.
it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it.
they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in cuba.
one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he did not attack the kennedy administration on this score.
his reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now.
but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first.
the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination.
kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by harvard boston university brandeis and massachusetts institute of technology educators.
detente urged.
this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups.
it recommends that the united states seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations.
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds.
mr nixon for his part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation.
but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated.
until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by mr nixon and the professors.
aid plans revamped.
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration.
strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements.
policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed.
but thus far there has been no response in kind.
foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations.
in laos the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture.
again and again it asked the communists to freeze the military situation in laos.
but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate.
and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge build-up administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization.
seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos.
but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over laos.
some seato nations disagreed however.
.
there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined neighbors thailand and south viet nam.
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos.
the pro-western government which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma neutralist government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army.
there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the pro-western government to the hilt.
if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma whom it felt was too trusting of communists it gradually had to relinquish them.
one factor was the statement of senator j w fulbright d of arkansas chairman of the senate foreign relations committee.
he declared on march that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of prince souvanna.
washington.
the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states.
the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation.
in an important assertion of national leadership in this field he has issued an executive order establishing the president committee on juvenile delinquency and crime to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.
the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend.
offenses multiply.
the president has also called upon the attorney general the secretary of health education and welfare and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem.
simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l hackett a special assistant to the attorney general as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime.
his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since each year showing an increase in offenders.
among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under years of age.
east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director raymond h hawksley the present city cd head believes.
mr hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.
east providence now has no civil defense program.
mr hawksley the state general treasurer has been a part-time cd director in the city for the last nine years.
he is not interested in being named a full-time director.
noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nation civil defense program mr hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director.
he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs.
mr hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time cd job.
one of these men is former fire chief john a laughlin he said.
along with a director the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized.
mr hawksley said.
one advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director he said is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program.
matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios sirens and rescue trucks he said.
mr hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station.
he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area.
speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city mr hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack.
the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point he said and a drive-in theater in seekonk would be another.
riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point.
mr hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack.
such vital information he said has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know.
if the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time cd director mr hawksley said then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally.
one of the first things he would do he said would be to organize classes in first aid.
other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government.
rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind.
governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly.
the governor move into the so-called blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r grant deputy city clerk of central falls.
a copy was released to the press.
mr notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july and sent to the state house by miss grant.
the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature.
while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review mr notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty gen j joseph nugent to get the benefit of his views.
he will then appoint the study committee with mr nugent cooperation the governor said.
i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings mr notte said to obtain the views of the general public and religious labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws.
the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales.
the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws.
should there be evidence they are shirking he has said the state police will step into the situation.
there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws.
the statutes similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath.
the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday.
the only day they have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday the council resolution said.
the small shops must be retained for they provide essential service to the community according to the resolution which added that they also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors.
it declares that sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government.
the council advised the governor that large supermarkets factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on sunday.
they operate on a volume basis it was contended and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community.
liberals and conservatives in both parties -- democratic and republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties george h reama nationally known labor-management expert said here yesterday.
mr reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheraton-biltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system.
he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day.
he said he was confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in.
that he added was when he was a very young man a machinist and toolmaker by trade.
that was before i studied law.
some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party.
the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track.
he steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track.
he said that when he was a socialist in the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources.
he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties.
mr reama who retired as vice president of the american screw co in said both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it.
he said he favors wage increases for workers -- but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices he added.
indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his philosophy mr reama said a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own.
mr reama far from really being retired is engaged in industrial relations counseling.
a petition bearing the signatures of more than johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.
william a martinelli chairman of the citizens group of johnston transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr.
the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within days and mr martinelli happens to hold that post.
mr martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within days.
he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within days after the board of canvassers completes its work.
a difference of opinion arose between mr martinelli and john p bourcier town solicitor over the exact manner in which the vote is handled.
mr martinelli has in recent weeks been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote while mr bourcier said that a special election might be called instead.
mr bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures.
he assured mr martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible.
mr martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july to plan further strategy in the charter movement.
he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes.
after inspiring this i think we should certainly follow through on it he declared.
it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement.
he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission.
our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement he indicated and to tell them what this will mean for the town.
he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september.
some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday with spokesmen for the town insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter.
increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks it was indicated.
misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed false pretenses.
several signers affixed their names it was learned after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system.
action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at monday special north providence town council meeting.
council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a abatuno to draft the ordinance.
at the last session of the general assembly the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective.
nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation.
at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition.
local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense.
plainfield.
-- james p mitchell and sen walter h jones r-bergen last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j hughes democratic gubernatorial candidate that the gop is campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism.
mitchell was for using it jones against and sen wayne dumont jr r-warren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before persons at the park hotel.
the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club.
it was greeted with a chorus of boos by women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of women clubs.
hughes said monday it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired.
now he gone the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state.
sunday he had added we can love eisenhower the man even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership.
mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign.
how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this.
he asked.
the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his adminstration.
mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue.
regrets attack.
jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president.
he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign he said because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign.
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes remark.
dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary.
he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign.
state aid to schools the continuance of railroad passenger service the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority and making new jersey attractive to new industry.
decries joblessness.
mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republican-controlled state senate must share the blame for this.
noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co plant he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform.
but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time mitchell said.
jones unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions saved his barbs for mitchell.
he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises.
he calls for help while saying he is against centralization but you ca not have it both ways jones said.
the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities real estate or motor vehicles he said and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue.
defends ike.
earlier mitchell said in a statement.
i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j hughes.
his reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the president leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations.
i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste.
such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature.
it can only rebound to mr hughes discredit.
sees jones ahead.
sen charles w sandman r-cape may said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination.
sandman state campaign chairman for jones was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel newark of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones.
sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican party nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years.
sandman said the announcement that sen clifford case aj has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr mitchell is a dead giveaway.
it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jersey problems.
we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington.
that failed.
we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr mitchell some of the glow of sen case candidacy of last year.
that too will fail.
sandman announced the appointment of mrs harriet copeland greenfield of woodland ave westfield as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee.
mrs greenfield is president of the westfield women republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman.
county supervisor weldon r sheets who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them.
the proposal sheets said represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a lip service word.
sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines enabling counties to repay the loan over a -year period without interest or charge.
sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january.
although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines.
the candidacy of mayor james j sheeran of west orange for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county was supported today by edward w roos west orange public safety commissioner.
sheeran a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organization candidate freeholder william macdonald for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy now a member of the state board of tax appeals.
my experience as public safety commissioner roos said has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience and preferably one who is a lawyer.
jim sheeran fits that description.
trenton.
-- william j seidel state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development has retired after years of service.
a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state.
seidel joined the department in as a division fire warden after graduation in from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies.
in october he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section.
under his supervision the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting.
he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station.
he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens.
he is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the red cross and state department of education.
boonton.
-- richard j hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge to carry the issues to every corner of the state.
he promised nearly democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn when i come back here after the november election you ll think you re my man -- you re the kind of governor we re glad we elected.
he said we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just and not what is expedient at the time.
attacks republicans.
in his only attack on the republicans hughes said the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary.
but we ll have a liberal well planned forward looking honest platform.
we ll not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson.
we ll take the truth to the people and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november.
he said you can see signs of the republicans feeble attack on the meyner administration.
but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead.
he urged new jersey to become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy.
he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry.
we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean the former superior court judge said.
to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early s.
calling the democrats the party that lives breathes and thinks for the good of the people hughes asked a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november.
hughes supported gov meyner green acres plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development.
he said legislation for a million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday.
conservation plan.
the plan will provide million for purchase of open land by the state.
the other million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis.
hughes said this is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it pointing out the state population has increased each year since.
he said morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas there will be no land left to preserve.
hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved.
he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans.
after the primary he promised i ll be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong dynamic administration.
i m not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee.
trenton.
-- fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues.
the outgoing members whose four-year terms will expire a week after the april primary election received carved wooden elephants complete with ivory tusks to remember the state committee by.
there may be other state committee retirements come april but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters.
a special presentation was made to mrs geraldine thompson of red bank who is stepping down after years on the committee.
she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early s following adoption of the women suffrage amendment.
she served one four-year term on the national committee.
resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r screvane and abraham d beame as running mates.
at the same time reaction among anti-organization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayor reported plan was generally favorable.
some anti-organization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years.
the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayor efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders.
some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party.
opposition reported.
some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept democratic primary.
these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city.
their view is that last-minute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor.
in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate mr wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a buckley the bronx democratic leader and with joseph t sharkey the brooklyn democratic leader.
mayor visits buckley.
as usual he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g de sapio the manhattan leader.
he is publicly on record as believing mr de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party.
last night the mayor visited mr buckley at the bronx leader home for a discussion of the situation.
apparently he believes mr buckley holds the key to the democratic organization acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle.
in talks with mr buckley last week in washington the mayor apparently received the bronx leader assent to dropping controller lawrence e gerosa who lives in the bronx from this year ticket.
but mr buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr gerosa successor.
screvane and beame hailed.
the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr screvane who lives in queens to replace abe stark the incumbent as the candidate for president of the city council and mr beame who lives in brooklyn to replace mr gerosa as the candidate for controller.
the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx.
after his speech reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions published in yesterday new york times.
the mayor said.
it did not come from me.
but as i have said before if i announce my candidacy i will have something definite to say about running mates.
boston june.
-- a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts.
there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics.
the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are all the same.
it see joe see jim he says.
the hand is out.
a political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt selfish and beyond popular control.
these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy the object of which is to plunder them.
corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin o connor novel the last hurrah.
but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject.
a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year.
graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations.
and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state.
a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery or worse is the norm in massachusetts public life.
day after day some new episode is reported.
the state public works department is accused of having spent to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property.
an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate.
washington june.
-- congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers.
in the senate several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition.
in the house the southern-republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administration housing bill while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill.
the housing bill is now in the house rules committee.
it is expected to be reported out tuesday but this is a little uncertain.
the panel action depends on the return of representative james w trimble democrat of arkansas who has been siding with speaker sam rayburn forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor.
mr trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday.
leadership is hopeful.
the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans.
the democratic leadership however hopes to pass it sometime this week.
the measure which was passed last monday by the senate provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families.
it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories.
the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy.
they are james j delaney of queens and thomas p o neill jr of massachusetts.
three groups to meet.
what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of.
this would provide for long-term federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science languages and mathematics.
mr delaney and mr o neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee.
about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups according to an official of the corps.
in the budget that has been submitted for congressional approval would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies.
twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage gordon boyce director of relations with the voluntary agencies said in a washington interview.
six of these were proposed by religious groups.
they will be for teaching agriculture and community development in southeast asia africa the middle east and latin america.
question raised.
interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods means and goals.
there are a number of ways this could happen the churchmen pointed out and here is an example.
last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled.
when he protested the hotel owner said.
why do you worry.
the u s government is paying for it.
the u s government pays for all its overseas workers.
missionary explains.
i do not work for the government the american said.
i m a missionary.
the hotel owner shrugged.
same thing he said.
and then some churchmen remarked there is a more classical church-state problem.
can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state.
r sargent shriver jr director of the corps is certain that they can.
no religious group he declared in an interview will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes.
moscow june.
-- at a gay party in the kremlin for president sukarno of indonesia premier khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said beaming look he took everything i had.
mr khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker.
indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of asia africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid.
the soviet union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations.
the communist countries allocated more than in economic aid alone last year according to western estimates.
this was the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in.
in more than communist technicians were present in those countries.
united nations n y june.
-- a committee of experts has recommended that a country population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations.
this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations.
one effect of the proposal which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength as in the past would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india.
india is the most populous united nations member with more than inhabitants.
the new formula for filling staff positions in the secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report.
the report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the united nations.
formula is due this week.
the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions is expected to receive the report this week.
the jobs formula is understood to follow these lines.
each of the organization ninety-nine members would get two professional posts such as political affairs officer a department head or an economist to start.
each member would get one post for each people in its population up to people or a maximum of fifteen posts.
each member with a population above would get one additional post for each additional people up to an unspecified cut-off point.

washington.
-- thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big inaugural parade on jan.
assuming the weather is halfway decent that day hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president john f kennedy and retiring president dwight d eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route.
pennsylvania avenue named for one of the original states perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint.
but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it.
many buildings.
within view of the avenue are some of the united states government tremendous buildings plus shrines and monuments.
of course pennsylvania the white house is the most famous address of the free world.
within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue begins a series of great federal buildings some a block long and all about seven-stories high.
great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue now about years old.
in the early spring of a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch women parade.
they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote.
in the presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time.
seats on square.
along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in is the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country most valuable records are kept.
also the department of justice building is located where j edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation.
street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania powered with lines that are underground.
many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square opposite the white house.
in this historic square are several statues but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen andrew jackson hero of the battle of new orleans.
moving past the presidential viewing stand and lafayette square will be at least marching units.
about military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade.

jackson miss.
-- what does offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi.
even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state immediate political future.
this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- gov ross barnett.
barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well.
consequently it is uncertain after nearly months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year.
could be scramble.
some predict the administration will settle down during and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far.
the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor office.
there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session it will really throw his administration into a scramble.
certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the legislative session.
if barnett does not call a special session in it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session.
the odds favor a special session more than likely early in the year.
districts issue.
legislators always get restless for a special session whether for the companionship or the per diem is not certain and if they start agitating.
barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure.
the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat.
with eyes focused on the third congressional district the historic delta district and congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature.
mississippi relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house.
split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck.
and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together.
future clouded.
barnett as the titular head of the democratic party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary.
with a democratic administration party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election.
now the picture is clouded and even us sens james o eastland and john c stennis who remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status.
reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen.
baton rouge la.
-- the gov jimmie h davis administration appears to face a difficult year in with the governor theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses.
the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue.
but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government.
the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from per cent to per cent.
the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program.
but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation.
legislators weary.
indeed the administration curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat.
the administration could not say why million was needed for a grant-in-aid program.
the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote.
the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes.
davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy.
if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration.
he could terminate special sessions of the legislature.
actually davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway.
many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration.
this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly.
they would like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is something they know to be ineffectual.
underlying concern.
passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition.
he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle.
then he could tell them to go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with the million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period.
it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that million since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one.
but if the administration should find it does not need the million for a grant-in-aid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes.
this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash.
it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year.
if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma.
since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues.
constant problem.
in either case it could call a special session of the legislature later in to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser.
the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor.
it is one that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem.
but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature.
this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year.
a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize.
any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.
the new year might see some house-cleaning either genuine or token depending upon developments to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms.
city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had an inside track with the city.

the city paid for work on of which no more than were repaired hemphill charged.
wide range in bids.
hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of for each joint.
the bid from a belanger and sons of cambridge mass which listed the same officers as hughes was per joint.
but hemphill added bids from other contractors ranged from to per joint.
berger decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference.
wagner said the city paid only to the hughes company.
we wo not know the full amount until we get a full report wagner said.
we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond berger said.
wagner replied ca not you just see the headline city hooked for.
know enough to sue.
berger insisted that we know enough to sue for the full amount.

ankara turkey oct ap.
-- turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with gen cemal gursel as president.
an agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on oct was reached after almost hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d etat.
by-passing the military junta which has ruled turkey since the overthrow of premier adnan menderes months ago the army general staff led by gen cedvet sunay had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government.
the army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on gen gursel as president.
gen gursel has headed the military junta the last months.
the military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned.
party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own.

helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically e m martin assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night.
martin who has been in office in washington d c for months spoke at the council annual meeting at the multnomah hotel.
he told some persons that the united states challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways following their own paths.
we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which if not identical is congenial with ours he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty.
patience needed.
insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice he said was the biggest detriment to the soviet union.
he cited east germany where after years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in and added so long as people rebel we must not give up.
martin called for patience on the part of americans.
the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build he said.
by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare he said.
individual help best.
we have no reason to fear failure but we must be extraordinarily patient the assistant secretary said.
economically martin said the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves.
private business is more effective than government aid he explained because individuals are able to work with the people themselves.
the united states must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country at what he termed a social cost.
martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country.
the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portland civil defense more plans for the city schools in event of attack.
but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go and whose advice it should follow.
the board members after hearing the coordination plea from mrs ralph h molvar sw maplecrest dr said they thought they had already been cooperating.
chairman c richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem in case of atomic attack but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go.
dr melvin w barnes superintendent said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership perhaps on the national level to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would be more fruitful and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district.
los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster he said.
nobody really expects to evacuate.
i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following.
mrs molvar who kept reiterating her request that they please take a stand said we must have faith in somebody -- on the local level and it would not be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children.
dr barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans even for a high school where there were lots of cars might not be realistic and would not work.
mrs molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowe program.
the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting.
it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done is going to be done and what it thought should be done.

a stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken friday by delegates to the th general council of the assemblies of god in session at the memorial coliseum.
the council revised in an effort to strengthen the denomination basic beliefs adopted in.
the changes unanimously adopted were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the bible.
the council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the bible.
at the adoption the rev t f zimmerman general superintendent commented the assemblies of god has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has without compromise stood for the great truths of the bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives.
new point added.
many changes involved minor editing and clarification.
however the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list.
the first of beliefs of the denomination now reads.
the scriptures both old and new testament are verbally inspired of god and are the revelation of god to man the infallible authoritative rule of faith and conduct.
the third belief in six points emphasizes the diety of the lord jesus christ and.
-- emphasizes the virgin birth.
-- the sinless life of christ.
-- his miracles.
-- his substitutionary work on the cross.
-- his bodily resurrection from the dead.
-- and his exaltation to the right hand of god.

in his opening address wednesday the rev mr zimmerman urged the delegates to consider a -year expansion program with breakthrough the theme for the first two years.
the rev r l brandt national secretary of the home missions department stressed the need for the first two years work.
surveys show that one out of three americans has vital contact with the church.
this means that more than million have no vital touch with the church or religious life he told delegates friday.
church loses pace.
talking of the rapid population growth upwards of babies born daily with an immigrant entering the united states every - minutes he said our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge.
in years we have opened churches the rev mr brandt said adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every persons.
in this light we need churches in illinois where we have.
in southern new england we have.
we need in rhode island we have none he said.
to step up the denomination program the rev mr brandt suggested the vision of new assemblies of god churches in the next years.
to accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods he said.
church meets change.
the church ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour.
a capsule view of proposed plans includes.
-- encouraging by every means all existing assemblies of god churches to start new churches.
-- engaging mature experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers.
-- surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers laymen who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project.
-- arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from - months as apprentices in well-established churches.
u s dist judge charles l powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys monday in portland insurance fraud trial.
denials were of motions of dismissal continuance mistrial separate trial acquittal striking of testimony and directed verdict.
in denying motions for dismissal judge powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are.
attorney dwight l schwab in behalf of defendant philip weinstein argued there is no evidence linking weinstein to the conspiracy but judge powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide.
proof lack charged.
schwab also declared there is no proof of weinstein entering a conspiracy to use the u s mails to defraud to which federal prosecutor a lawrence burbank replied.
it is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the u s mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy and the mails were then used to carry it out.
in the afternoon defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case.

-- two errors by new york yankee shortstop tony kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a -to- victory to the chicago white sox today.
austin texas.
-- a texas halfback who does not even know the team plays eldon moritz ranks fourth in southwest conference scoring after three games.
time stands still every time moritz a -year-old army signal corps veteran goes into the field.
although he never gets to play while the clock is running he gets a big kick -- several every saturday in fact -- out of football.
moritz does not even have a nose guard or hip pads but he one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl.
that because he already has kicked extra points in tries.
he ran his string of successful conversions this season to straight before one went astray last saturday night in the - slaughter of washington state.
moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback the position at which he lettered on the team.
but ask coach darrell royal what position he plays and you ll get the quick response place-kicker.
a -pound -foot -inch senior from stamford moritz practices nothing but place-kicking.
last year when he worked out at halfback all season he did not get into a single game.
this year coach royal told me if i d work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me said moritz.
so i started practicing on it in spring training.
moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right kicking leg and as a result several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough.
moritz said monday his leg feels fine and as a result he hopes to start practicing field goals this week.
he kicked several while playing at stamford high school including one that beat anson - in a district game.
i kicked about extra points in tries during three years in high school he said and made in a row at one time.
i never did miss one in a playoff game -- i kicked about in the five playoff games my last two years.
moritz came to texas in but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury.
he missed the season because of an operation on the ailing knee then played minutes in.
his statistical record that year when texas won only one game and lost nine was far from impressive he carried the ball three times for a net gain of yards punted once for yards and caught one pass for yards.
he went into the army in march and returned two years later.
but he was scholastically ineligible in and merely present last season.
place kicking is largely a matter of timing moritz declared.
once you get the feel of it there not much to it.
i ve tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them ca not seem to get the feel.
practice helps you to get your timing down.
it kind of like golf -- if you do not swing a club very often your timing gets off.
moritz however kicks only about or extra points during each practice session.
if you kick too much your leg gets kinda dead he explained.

in their first three games the longhorns have had the ball times and scored times or per cent.
their total passing yardage in three games on completions in attempts is only yards short of their total passing yardage in when they made on completions in tries.

he now has yards in tries during three games.
saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the washington state game for four plays he returned the kickoff yards gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a -yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench.
wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists he ll be ready for oklahoma.
last week when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the conference top four in rushing he said that wo not last long.
it did not.
monday he had four longhorns in the top four.
a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday but attention quickly turned from saturday victory to next week problem rice university.
the mustangs do not play this week.
we re just real happy for the players coach bill meek said of the - victory over the air force academy.
i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on.
it was the first time we ve been ahead this season when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal.
assistant coach john cudmore described victory as a good feeling i think on the part of the coaches and the players.
we needed it and we got it.
meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon.
both turned in top jobs for the second straight game.
nelson played magnificent football meek praised.
he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times.
and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown.
he broke that boy air force fullback nick arshinkoff in two and knocked him loose from the football.
gannon contributed saving plays on the falcons aerial thrusts in the late stages.
one was on a fourth-down screen pass from the mustang after an incomplete pass into gannon territory.
as soon as it started to form gannon spotted it meek said.
he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy halfback terry isaacson had time to turn around.
he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss.
the air force and the game final play was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own and returned yards.
he just lay back there and waited for it meek said.
he almost brought it back all the way.
except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice.
kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game meek said.
he ll be out of action all this week.
he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game.
there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee.
rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland.
he looking a lot better and he able to run meek explained.
we ll let him do a lot of running this week but i do not know if he ll be able to play.
the game players saw the air force film monday ran for minutes then went in while the reserves scrimmaged for minutes.
we ll work hard tuesday wednesday and thursday meek said and probably will have a good scrimmage friday.

the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts -- a - triumph over the denver broncos -- but their visit will be a short one.
the texans have two more road games -- at buffalo and houston -- before they play for the home folks again and it looks as if coach hank stram men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings.
buffalo coach buster ramsey who has become one of the game greatest collectors of quarterbacks apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-national football leaguers m c reynolds and warren rabb.
rabb the former louisiana state field general came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a - upset victory over the houston oilers defending league champions.
just our luck.
exclaimed stram.
buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way.
ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star jack spikes though he did the team place-kicking while nursing a knee injury.
our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game.
in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job.
the texans won the game through ball control with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only passes.
we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack explained stram.
they can be going along doing little damage then bang bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble.
the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off.
the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes the flashy halfback.
he was called upon times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered yards.
the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denver al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson the speedy halfback hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas.
a quick touchdown resulted.
that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away said stram quipping i think i ll put that play in the book.
the early southwest conference football leaders -- texas arkansas and texas a m -- made a big dent in the statistics last week.
texas -yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a -game total offense of yards rushing and passing a new swc high.
arkansas combined yards rushing with yards passing on completions in tosses and a tough defense to whip tcu and a m with a -point bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since.

rookie ron nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching monday night as the bears made it two straight over indianapolis -.
the husky - -pound lefthander was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only and countless of television viewers in the denver area.
it was nischwitz third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies winning streak to four straight.
they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack.
nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning.
he has given only the one pass in his innings an unusual characteristic for a southpaw.
the bears took the lead in the first inning as they did in sunday opener and never lagged.
dick mcauliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against lefty don rudolph to open the bear attack.

st paul-minneapolis may -- ap.
-- billy gardner line double which just eluded the diving minnie minoso in left field drove in jim lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the minnesota twins a - victory over the chicago white sox monday.
lemon was on with his fourth single of the game a liner to center.

ogden utah may -- ap.
-- boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball.
i ve had it he told a newsman.
i know when my reflexes are gone and i m not going to be any th man on the ball club.
this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout.
jensen got only six hits in at-bats for a batting average in the first games.
he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday without an official word to anybody and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno nev where his wife former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen awaited.
she said when she learned jackie was heading home i m just speculating but i have to think jack feels he hurting boston chances.
the union pacific railroad streamliner city of san francisco stopped in ogden utah for a few minutes.
sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him.
the conductor said to ritchie i do not think you want to talk to him.
you ll probably get a ball bat on the head.
he mad at the world.
but jackie had gone into the station.
ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand.
i told him who i was and he was quite cold.
but he warmed up after a while.
i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a double-crosser and said anything he liston got was through a keyhole.
he said he had never talked to liston.
liston is bill liston baseball writer for the boston traveler who quoted jensen as saying.
i ca not hit anymore.
i ca not run.
i ca not throw.
suddenly my reflexes are gone.
just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging.
and so it was over the weekend what with -year-old warren spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the giants and the giants willie mays retaliating with a record-tying -homer spree sunday.
both of course were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime.
of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahn hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts.
it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the -score-year milestone.
and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked wish i was and a top-grade big leaguer.
the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days.
but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game history.
yes with bob grove carl hubbell herb pennock art nehf vernon gomez et al.
spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow a ball player ball player as they say in the trade.
i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct before a new record crowd for the period of.
spahnie does not know how to merely go through the motions remarked enos slaughter another all-out guy who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse.
the spectacular mays who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings.
incidentally only two did it before a home audience.
bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyn ebbetts field.
ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies the braves joe adcock lou gehrig of the yankees pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito then with cleveland made their history on the road.
willie big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle.
this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion depending on whether you re an american or national fan and anti or pro-yankee.
the record books however would favor the giants ace.
in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as home runs and stole as many as bases.
once the figure was -.
willie lifetime batting average of is points beyond mickey.
the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukee park.
it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump.
the denver-area tv audience was privileged to see mays four home runs thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home.
this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game top rulers.
the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the living room athletic club when games were cut off.
actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy.
this year i am told the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here.
there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise.
it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good especially at the minor league level.
you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy.
this dissatisfaction led to howsam request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game.
cincinnati ohio ap.
-- the powerful new york yankees won their th world series in a -game romp over outclassed cincinnati crushing the reds in a humiliating - barrage monday in the loosely played finale.
with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries the american league champs still mounted a -hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers the most ever used by one team in a series game.
johnny blanchard mantle replacement slammed a -run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a -run first inning.
hector lopez subbing for berra smashed a -run homer off bill henry during another -run explosion in the fourth.
the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors.
the crowd of had only two chances to applaud.
in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center about feet away with two men on.
momentarily the reds were back in the ball game trailing only - but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out.
in the fifth wally post slashed a -run homer off bud daley but by that time the score was - and it really did not matter.
the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager.
only bucky harris the boy-manager of washington in and eddie dyer of the st louis cardinals in had accomplished the feat.
philadelphia jan.
-- nick skorich the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles was elevated today to head coach.
skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between and a year.
he succeeds buck shaw who retired at the end of last season.
the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaw staff -- jerry williams and charlie gauer.
williams is a defensive coach.
gauer works with the ends.
choice was expected.
the selection had been expected.
skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings the newest national football league entry.
van brocklin the quarterback who led the eagles to the title was signed by the vikings last wednesday.
philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player.
with skorich at the helm the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running rather than passing.
in the past the club depended largely on van brocklin aerials.
skorich however is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing.
coach played years.
skorich who is years old played football at cincinnati university and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers.
an injury forced skorich to quit after the season.
he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in.
he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy n y.
he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach.
four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers.
the eagles signed him for shaw staff in.
skorich began his new job auspiciously today.
at a ceremony in the reception room of mayor richardson dilworth the eagles were honored for winning the championship.
shaw and skorich headed a group of players coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football.

the -year-old shea a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a national league club to new york.
named by mayor wagner three years ago to head a committee that included james a farley bernard gimbel and clint blume shea worked relentlessly.
his goal was to obtain a national league team for this city.
the departure of the giants and the dodgers to california left new york with only the yankees.
despite countless barriers and disappointments shea moved forward.
when he was unable to bring about immediate expansion he sought to convince another national league club to move here.
when that failed he enlisted branch rickey aid in the formation of a third major league the continental with new york as the key franchise.
the continental league never got off the ground but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand.
flushing stadium in works.
the new york franchise is headed by mrs charles shipman payson.
a big-league municipal stadium at flushing meadow park is in the works and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by commissioner ford c frick.
shea efforts figure prominently in the new stadium.
shea and his wife nori make their home at sands point l i.
bill jr kathy and patricia round out the shea family.
shea was born in manhattan.
he attended new york university before switching to georgetown university in washington.
he played basketball there while working toward a law degree.
later shea owned and operated the long island indians a minor league professional football team.
he was the lawyer for ted collins old boston yankees in the national football league.
all was quiet in the office of the yankees and the local national leaguers yesterday.
on friday roger maris the yankee outfielder and winner of the american league most-valuable-player award will meet with roy hamey the general manager.
maris is in line for a big raise.
arnold palmer and sam snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the metropolitan golf writers association tonight.
the dinner will be held at the hotel pierre.
palmer golf leading money-winner in and snead will be saluted as the winning team in the canada cup matches last june in dublin.
deane beman the national amateur champion and all the metropolitan district champions including bob gardner the amateur title-holder also will receive awards.
the writers gold tee award will go to john mcauliffe of plainfield n j and palm beach fla for his sponsorship of charity tournaments.
horton smith of detroit a former president of the professional golfers association will receive the ben hogan trophy for his comeback following a recent illness.
the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington democrat of missouri.
golf golden boy.
arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months.
he won the masters the united states open and a record in prize money.
he was heralded as sportsman of the year by sports illustrated and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the professional athlete of the year a distinction that earned for him the diamond-studded hickok belt.
but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot.
a couple of weeks ago he scored a monstrous on a par- hole.
it made him human.
and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair.
if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege there was hope left for all.
it was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold.
he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all.
the world best golfer shooting below par came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher.
he boomed a -yard drive.
then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance.
no margin for error.
on the narrow fairway of a -yard hole arnold whipped into his second shot.
the ball went off in a majestic arc an out-of-bounds slice.
he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds.
he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side.
it is possible that i over-corrected he said ruefully.
each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes.
so he wound up with a dozen.
it was a nice round figure that he said as he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed.
from the standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an in the texas open.
the idol of the hackers of course is ray ainsley who achieved a in the united states open.
their secondary hero is another pro willie chisholm who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully.
willie partner was long jim barnes who tried to keep count.
stickler for rules.
how many is that jim.
asked willie at one stage of his excavation project.
thirteen said long jim.
nae man said willie ye must be countin the echoes.
he had a.
palmer dozen were honestly earned.
nor were there any rules to save him.
if there had been he would have found a loophole because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book.
this knowledge has come in handy too.
his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway.
the ball floated downstream.
a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie.
arnold sent for joe dey the executive secretary of the golf association.
joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream.
i knew it all along confessed arnold with a grin but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there.
for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings.
yet he remains the fiercest of competitors.
he ll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he right.
that how he first won the masters in.
it happened on the twelfth hole a -yarder.
arnold iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains thereby bringing local rules into force.
ruling from on high.
i can remove the ball ca not i.
asked palmer of an official.
no said the official.
you must play it where it lies.
you re wrong said arnold a man who knows the rules.
i ll do as you say but i ll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling.
he scored a for the embedded ball a with the provisional one.
the golfing fathers ruled in his favor.
so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke.
until a few weeks ago however arnold palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers.
but after that at los angeles he became one of the boys a bigger hero than he ever had been before.
a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today.
other items on the agenda during the meetings which are expected to continue through saturday concern television rules changes professional football hall of fame players benefits and constitutional amendments.
the owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division plus two games against teams in the other division.
however this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks.
pete rozelle the league commissioner pointed out.
we ll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other.
nine of the league teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates.
if the cardinals heed manager gene mauch of the phillies they wo not be misled by the pirates slower start this season.
pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat mauch said here the other day.
the pirates showed they could outclass the field last year.
they have the same men no age problem no injuries and they also have vinegar bend mizell for the full season along with bobby shantz.
tonight at o clock the cardinals who gave the pirates as much trouble as anyone did in breaking even with them will get their first shot at baseball world champions.
the pirates have a - record this year and the redbirds are -.
change in pitchers.
solly hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher from bob gibson to ernie broglio for several reasons broglio - won-lost record and earned-run mark against pittsburgh a year ago.
the desire to give broglio as many starts as possible.
the redbirds disheartening - collapse against the phillies sunday.
manager hemus eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand moved gibson to the wednesday night starting assignment.
after thursday open date solly plans to open with larry jackson against the cubs here friday night.
harvey haddix set back by the flu this season will start against his former cardinal mates who might be playing without captain kenny boyer in tonight game at busch stadium.
boyer is suffering from a stiff neck.
haddix has a - record against the redbirds despite only a - mark in.
pirate manager danny murtaugh said he had not decided between mizell and vern law for wednesday game.
mizell has won both of his starts.
nieman kept in lineup.
after a lengthy workout yesterday an open date hemus said that bob nieman definitely would stay in the lineup.
that means stan musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the giants.
i have to stay with nieman for a while hemus said.
bill white sore ankles should be ready.
with a lefthander going for pittsburgh i may use don taussig in center.
lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about minutes and he looked good hemus said.
he should be getting back in the groove before long.
our pitching is much better than it has shown.
the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday.
six bucks over.
until the bucs bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend the champions had eight men hitting over.
despite the recession pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages smoky burgess gino cimoli bill virdon bob clemente and dick groat each.
dick stuart don hoak.
and bob skinner.
.
bill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet.
perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs.
friend is off to a great start with a - record but is not likely to see action here this week.
we re getting friend some runs for a change and he has been pitching good murtaugh said.
virdon has been blasting the ball.
no plunkers for him.
six bucs over.
the pirates jumped off to an - start by may last year when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season.
on last may the cardinals stood at - ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone.
in the birds were - on may.
a year later they were -.
since the st louis club has been below on may just four times.
the team was off to a so-so - beginning then fell as low as - on may before finishing with victories.
the cards were - on may but ended with triumphs the club top since.
then last season the birds tumbled as low as - on may before recovering to make a race of it and total victories.
since the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the dodger team.
those dodgers won their first games and owned a - mark and a nine-game lead by may.
the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new york giants who dropped of their first.
they honored the battling billikens last night.
speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st louis university players who in the words of coach john benington had more confidence in themselves than i did.
the most valuable player award was split three ways among glen mankowski gordon hartweger and tom kieffer.
in addition a special award was given to bob bevo nordmann the -foot- center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury.
you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies but what this team had was a little different.
the boys had a tremendous respect for each other ability.
they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do.
several times i found the players pepping me up where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk.
we d be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say do not worry coach -- we ll get em all right.
the trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by bob broeg sports editor of the post-dispatch.
kieffer the only junior in the group was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch as well as his all-round excellent play.
mankowski the ball-hawking defensive expert was cited for his performance against bradley in st louis u nationally televised victory.
benington said i ve never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day.
benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills.
after the coach listed all the boy faults hartweger said coach before i leave here you ll get to like me.
mrs benington admired gordon spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team.
as hartweger accepted his silver bowl he said i want to thank coach wife for talking him into letting me play.
bob burnes sports editor of the globe-democrat presented bob nordmann with his award.
bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time.
within a week after the injury suffered in st louis victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament nordmann was sitting on the bill bench doing what he could to help benington.
on the clock given him was the inscription for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball -.
other lettermen from the team that compiled a - record and finished as runner-up in the national invitation tournament were art hambric donnell reid bill nordmann dave harris dave luechtefeld and george latinovich.
this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future benington pointed out.
by winning against bradley kentucky and notre dame on those teams home courts they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it does not take a super team to do it.
st louis university found a way to win a baseball game.
larry scherer last night pitched a no-hit game said to be the first in billiken baseball history as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college - at crystal city.
the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie.
the tie was against southeast missouri last friday.
scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double len boehmer also was -for- with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple.
st louis u was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at against washington university at ligget field.
the game opened a busy week for washington.
the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy ill saturday.
happy hitting.
if it true that contented cows give more milk why should not happy ball players produce more base hits.
the two top talents of the time mickey mantle and willie mays have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which to be frank about it never have quite reached expectations.
and that meant as a boost not a knock.
mays and mantle both -year men at have so much ability that baseball men agree they ve never hit the heights.
their heights that is.
mantle the bull-necked blond switch-hitter had one sensational triple-crown season when he batted and also led the american league in home runs and rbi.
like the yankees slugger mays the terror of the giants has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players but not by -- or for -- willie.
his best years were when he hit with homers and when he belted home runs drove in and stole bases.
now apparently happier under new managers mays and mantle the perfect players are behaving as though they re going to pass those previous peaks.
labor relations.
yes we know they re professionals men paid to play and they should not care how they re handled just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month.
the truth is though that men react differently to different treatment.
for that matter stan musial is rare possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers reserving his opinions but not his effort.
mantle it apparent resented casey stengel attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility.
the old man was almost too possessive.
stengel inherited dimaggio rizzuto but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors from joplin to new york.
with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him ol case wanted no to be not only the best homerun hitter but also the best bunter base-runner and outfielder.
stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats.
inheriting a more mature mantle who now has seen the sights on and off broadway ralph houk quietly bestowed no pun intended the mantle of authority on mickey.
the major decided that rather than be led the slugger could lead.
and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far.
the opinion continues here that with a -game schedule pitching spread thin through a -team league and a most inviting target in los angeles wrigley field jr mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books babe ruth homers of.
four for alvin.
mays day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year.
willie wonderful walloping sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark.
next to leo durocher dark taught mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the polo grounds years ago this month to help the giants win a dramatic pennant.

those qualities make esther marr a popular asset at the salvation army social center at larimer st.
the pert gray-haired woman who came to denver three years ago from buffalo n y is a civilian with the army.
her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director.
the job also covers a number of other items.
mom marr as the more than men at the center call her is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society.
her day starts early but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written and during may which is national salvation army week there are plenty schedules to be made or problems to be solved mrs marr office is always open and the welcome mat is out.
mrs marr is the first contact a skid row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up.
she sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures.
usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men mrs marr explained.
the denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center.
and i bum tickets to everything i can she said.
i ve become the greatest beggar in the world.

by mid-june millions of americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land.
in another four weeks with schools closed across the nation the great all-american summer safari will be under way.
by july six weeks from now motel-keepers all over the nation will by p m be switching on that bleak -- to motorists -- sign no vacancy.
no matter how many americans go abroad in summer probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car throw suitcases kids and comic books in the back seat and head for home.
and where is home that magic place of the heart.
ah that is simple.
home is where a man was born reared went to school and most particularly where grandma is.
that is where we turn in the good old summertime.
the land lies ready for the coming onslaught.
my husband and i a month ahead of the rush have just finished a -day motor journey of miles from tucson ariz to new york city.
set for influx.
i can testify that motels service and comfort stations they go together like scots and heather dog wagons roadside restaurants souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting.
i hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent far-flung over-night accommodations.
maybe motel-keeping is not the nation biggest industry but it certainly looks that way from the highway.
there are motels for all purposes and all tastes.
there are even motels for local weather peculiarities in shamrock tex as i discovered.
there the royal motel advertises all facilities vented heat air conditioned carpeted free tv storm cellar.
many with pools.
innumerable motels from tucson to new york boast swimming pools swim at your own risk is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools.
some even boast two pools one for adults and one for children.
but the royal motel in shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar.
motorists like myself who can remember the old tourists accommodated signs on farm houses and village homes before world war can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business.
all for.
at the boxwood motel in winchester va we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting gold and white furniture pink satin brocade chairs -inch tv and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels.
all for.
that made up for the best motel in norman okla where the proprietor knocked off the tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture.

the baltimore and ohio railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at a m next saturday.
the current monthly payroll comes to about.
howard e simpson the railroad president said a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action.
the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the b o operates.
salary cut and lay-offs.
it will be accomplished in two ways.
a flat reduction of per cent in the salary of all officers supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions.
there are about officers and employees in this class.
.
sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a per cent cut in the union payroll expense.
since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough a b o spokesman said.
those union members kept on their jobs therefore will not take a cut in their wages.
the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job.

annapolis jan.
-- the anne arundel county school superintendent has asked that the board of education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what.
the proposal was made by dr david s jenkins after he and mrs d ellwood williams jr a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent argued for about fifteen minutes at this week meeting.
the disagreement was over what dr jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting.
cites discrepancies.
mrs williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr jenkins conversation and how they were written up for the board approval.
i hate to have these things come up again and again dr jenkins commented as he made his suggestion.
these are the board minutes.
i ll write what you tell me to.
for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago.
it was about that time a board member said later that dr thomas g pullen jr state superintendent of schools told dr jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him.
the board of county commissioners the sanitary commission the planning and zoning board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings.
dr jenkins notes however that most of the school boards in the state do not do so.

councilman william d schaefer d fifth said in a letter to mayor grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month.
werner criticized.
conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than baltimore after the last storm mr schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here.
he said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in december.
equipment should be in operation almost immediately after the first snowfall mr schaefer said.
the councilman who is the administration floor leader also criticized bernard l werner public works director for halting snow operations on tuesday night after the sunday storm.
sent home for rest.
mr werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week.
what he did mr werner said was let manual laborers go home tuesday night for some rest.
work resumed wednesday he said.
mr schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them should be strictly enforced.
admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive.
recounting personal observations of clearance work the councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes.
