Wayne Rooney rolled back the years as his stunning 30-yard free-kick earned DC United a 1-0 home win over Toronto. The former England captain bent a glorious effort over the wall and into the top corner in the 18th minute.Victory strengthened United’s hold on a play-off spot in the Eastern Conference, they are now four points ahead of Montreal Impact for the sixth and final playoff place with two matches remaining. A victory in their next match would seal their place in the postseason, a remarkable achievement given they were at the bottom of the Eastern Conference when Rooney joined the club. Pure class. @WayneRooney midweek magic. ✨#DCU | #DCvTOR 1-0 pic.twitter.com/zhYwM0JZTGRooney can take credit for much of the team’s improvement. When he arrived, DC had taken 11 points from their first 14 games of the season, winning just twice. In the 18 matches that have followed they have won 11 times and accrued 36 points. The Toronto result was their fourth successive victory.His goal against Toronto made it six in his last five games, and he has a total of 10 in 18 MLS appearances. He has registered a brace on three occasions, and also produced seven assists so far.It is not just Rooney’s goals that have been impressive though. In stoppage time at the end of August’s 3-2 triumph against Orlando City at Audi Field, the visitors looked set to snatch victory as they launched a counter-attack. Will Johnson broke free, but Rooney sprinted back and won the ball with a last-ditch tackle. He then advanced forward and sent a wonderful delivery into the box, where Luciano Acosta headed home the clinching goal.
