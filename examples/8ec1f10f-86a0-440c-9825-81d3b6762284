Right, let’s get straight into the heart of things. After last weekend’s set of fourth-round qualifying fixtures, both Metropolitan Police and Haringey Borough will be praying for a plum draw against one of the bigger sides in the draw at this stage. The former, who play in the Southern League Premier Division South overcame Havant and Waterlooville to reach the first round, while Haringey got the better of Poole Town at their Coles Park Stadium, on White Hart Lane, to reach this round of the competition for the first time in their history. It goes without saying, but for those sides, getting here is a big deal; each team that reached this stage has already cashed £25,000 in prize money, while victory in the first-round proper is worth a cool £36,000. League One outfits Sunderland, Portsmouth, Charlton Athletic or Barnsley will not be quite so keen. Meanwhile, Hitchin Town, who are hosting tonight’s draw, will also be aiming to play in the first round by beating Leatherhead in this week’s replay. As for Peterborough United manager Steve Evans, his wishes are fairly simple. “I want the lowest ranked team at home, and if I can’t have them, then give me Cambridge United.”Updated
