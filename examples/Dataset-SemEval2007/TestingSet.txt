Comment: this is not quite straightforward. There is a temporal element -- is the wine in the bottle? One way to resolve this is by elimination. Only Measured-Measure might also apply, but there is no hint of measure or quantity here. Still, the sentence does not entail that the wine is in the bottle, so Content-Container is merely a feasible interpretation.

WordNet(e1) = "battery%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "refrigerator%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "batteries stored in"

171 "The <e1>box</e1> contained 126 <e2>recipes</e2>, mostly written in pen in neatly rounded script."
WordNet(e1) = "box%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "recipe%1:10:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "the box contained"
Comment: "recipe" interpreted as a physical object. We have metonymy here (a piece of paper on which the recipes are written).

172 "The <e1>ghosts</e1> in my <e2>house</e2> are mischievous, like little children."
WordNet(e1) = "ghost%1:09:00::", WordNet(e2) = "house%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "the * in my house"

WordNet(e1) = "kitchen%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "opportunity%1:26:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the kitchen holds"

WordNet(e1) = "box%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "legacy%1:21:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "the box contained"
Comment: a case of extreme metonymy. While there aren't enough clues, this sentence may be read as "the box contained [papers representing] an entire legacy".

175 "The <e1>list</e1> contained <e2>books</e2> of various genres and reading and interest levels."
WordNet(e1) = "list%1:10:00::", WordNet(e2) = "book%1:10:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the * contained books"
Comment: a list has components, so the best relation here is Whole-Part. Note, too, that sense n8 is the most generic, non-physical (publication).

176 "The <e1>box</e1> holds the <e2>answer</e2> to how you got trapped."
WordNet(e1) = "box%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "answer%1:10:02::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the box holds"
Comment: it seems too metaphorical; a non-container sense of "hold".

WordNet(e1) = "envelope%1:06:01::", WordNet(e2) = "notepaper%1:10:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "contents of the * were a"

WordNet(e1) = "candy%1:13:00::", WordNet(e2) = "underwear%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "candy in my"
Comment: Located-Location. It is hard to treat underwear as a flexible container (a bag), impossible -- as a rigid container (a box).

183 "On windy days I can feel drafts coming from the <e1>baseboards</e1> in my <e2>house</e2>."

Comment: Part-Whole.

WordNet(e1) = "temperature%1:07:00::", WordNet(e2) = "car%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "the * inside the car"
Comment: another brain-teaser; perhaps Measure, but it is not clear.

185 "As the officer shone his flashlight on the lock he was working on, he spotted a <e1>marijuana pipe</e1> laying on the floor inside the <e2>car</e2>."
WordNet(e1) = "pipe%1:06:01::", WordNet(e2) = "car%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "the * inside the car"
Comment: Located-Location is competitive.

187 "Located inside the <e1>cave</e1> was an old, broken-down army field <e2>telephone</e2>."
WordNet(e1) = "cave%1:17:00::", WordNet(e2) = "telephone%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "located inside the cave"
Comment: a cave is more a location than a container (and the word "located" is likely to suggest Location-Located), but this example can be interpreted as Content-Container.

188 "The goal of the study was to determine the percentage of adult Americans who keep <e1>money</e1> in a regular <e2>savings account</e2>."

Comment: a difficult case, and an instance of metonymy; no relation comes easily to mind.

199 "The other contents of the <e1>suitcase</e1> included some <e2>gym shoes</e2>, dirty sweat socks, Limburger cheese, scented oils, and a severely poop stained Armani suit."
