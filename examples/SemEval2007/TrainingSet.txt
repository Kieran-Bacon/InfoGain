WordNet(e1) = "battery%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "phone%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "batteries kept in"
Comment: the sentence does not entail that the batteries are inside the phone, though it is a likely intepretation. The real issue is that batteries are part of what we normally consider a working phone.

004 "This answer leads me to think that the <e1>robber</e1> was inside the <e2>office</e2> when the manager decided to take action and escape out the side door."
WordNet(e1) = "robber%1:18:01::", WordNet(e2) = "office%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "the * was inside the"
Comment: Located-Location.

005 "Often the <e1>patient</e1> is kept in the <e2>hospital</e2> one night for observation, but in other cases the patient can be discharged home the same day as surgery."
WordNet(e1) = "patient%1:18:00::", WordNet(e2) = "hospital%1:14:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "the * is kept in the"
Comment: not sure what relation it is. Either sense of "hospital" fits.

006 "<e1>Batteries</e1> stored in <e2>contact</e2> with one another can generate heat and hydrogen gas."
WordNet(e1) = "battery%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "contact%1:26:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "batteries stored in"
Comment: "in contact with" is a compound preposition, or a phrase which serves as a preposition.

007 "Among the contents of the <e1>vessel</e1> were a set of carpenter's <e2>tools</e2>, several large storage jars, ceramic utensils, ropes and remnants of food, as well as a heavy load of ballast stones."
WordNet(e1) = "vessel%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "tool%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "contents of the * were a"

008 "You can put <e1>wine</e1> in the <e2>hookah water</e2>, and otherwise adulterate the tobacco and so on to change the flavor."
WordNet(e1) = "wine%1:07:00::", WordNet(e2) = "water%1:13:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "put wine in the"
Comment: this cannot be Part-Whole (wine might be part, but water can only be whole after the putting has occurred -- something not entailed by the sentence). It is also not quite Located-Location: putting is not a fact but a possibility. Such temporal uncertainties are tough to interpret.

009 "And we do recommend excersise, as the <e1>kitchen</e1> holds <e2>culinary temptations</e2> in store for you that are bound to prolong your evening and lift your spirit."
WordNet(e1) = "kitchen%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "temptation%1:09:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the kitchen holds"
Comment: Located-Location; it is a different sense of the verb "hold", and note that WN 3.0 offers 36 (!) senses.

010 "The <e1>catalogue</e1> contained <e2>books</e2> published in 1998 warning of the upcoming millennium bug and other similarly germane works, but neither of Brock's bestsellers."
WordNet(e1) = "catalogue%1:10:01::", WordNet(e2) = "book%1:10:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the * contained books"
Comment: a catalog is either "a complete list of things" or "a book or pamphlet containing an enumeration of things". There is metonymy here: a book means some "listable" identification of a book. This is Part-Whole.

011 "Vinegar's <e1>usefulness</e1> doesn't stop inside the <e2>house</e2>."
WordNet(e1) = "usefulness%1:07:00::", WordNet(e2) = "house%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "inside the house"
Comment: definitely no relation fits this example adequately.

012 "You'll rarely see a <e1>clock</e1> inside a <e2>casino</e2>, the same goes for windows."
WordNet(e1) = "clock%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "casino%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "a clock inside a"
Comment: Located-Location.

013 "The original Waldorf <e1>salad</e1>, created at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel in the 1890s, contained only <e2>apples</e2>, mayonnaise, and celery."
WordNet(e1) = "salad%1:13:00::", WordNet(e2) = "apple%1:13:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the * contained apples"
Comment: ingredient, so Object-Stuff, a subcategory of Whole-Part.

014 "The <e1>library</e1> contained <e2>books</e2> of guidance on the processes."
WordNet(e1) = "library%1:14:00::", WordNet(e2) = "book%1:10:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "the * contained books"
Comment: marginal; Located-Location is tempting, too.

015 "The story not only put <e1>wine</e1> in a <e2>positive health light</e2>, but pointed out that it was superior to other foods in that particular regard."
WordNet(e1) = "wine%1:07:00::", WordNet(e2) = "light%1:09:01::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "put wine in a"
Comment: a difficult case, and an instance of metonymy; no relation comes easily to mind.

016 "Our water froze and <e1>batteries</e1> kept in <e2>pockets</e2> got cold."
WordNet(e1) = "battery%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "pocket%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "batteries kept in"

017 "How do I recognize a <e1>room</e1> that contains <e2>radioactive materials</e2>?"
WordNet(e1) = "room%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "radioactive_material%1:27:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "room that contains"
Comment: Location-Located is almost equally good.

018 "<e1>Equipment</e1> for making repairs en route was carried in a <e2>jockey box</e2> attached to one end or side of the wagon."
WordNet(e1) = "equipment%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "box%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "carried in a"

019 "The <e1>video</e1> contains a <e2>clip</e2> from the movie."
WordNet(e1) = "video%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "?", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the * contains"
Comment: Whole-Part. "Clip" in this sense absent in WordNet.

020 "The contents of the <e1>cyst</e1> included a foul smelling <e2>gas</e2> and white-green pus."
WordNet(e1) = "cyst%1:26:00::", WordNet(e2) = "gas%1:26:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "contents of the * included"
Comment: Stuff-Object, a subcategory of Part-Whole.

021 "The contents of the <e1>memorandum</e1> included <e2>stigmatizing statements</e2> about Cannon."
WordNet(e1) = "memorandum%1:10:00::", WordNet(e2) = "statement%1:10:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "contents of the * included"
Comment: Whole-Part.

022 "The <e1>display table</e1> contained <e2>books</e2> and posters for visitors to browse."
WordNet(e1) = "table%1:17:00::", WordNet(e2) = "book%1:10:05::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the * contained books"
Comment: Located-Location.

023 "The <e1>bomb</e1> was contained in a <e2>suitcase</e2> and was planted by two men."
WordNet(e1) = "bomb%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "suitcase%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "contained in a suitcase"

024 "We kept the <e1>antenna</e1> inside the <e2>car</e2>, which limited range due to the car's attenuation."
WordNet(e1) = "antenna%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "car%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "the * inside the car"
Comment: Located-Location; Part-Whole if the antenna is attached.

025 "Any <e1>marinade</e1> that contains <e2>acid</e2>, alcohol or salt should not be used for very long, because it will chemically 'cook' or denature the food in it."
WordNet(e1) = "marinade%1:13:00::", WordNet(e2) = "acid%1:27:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "that contains acid"
Comment: Object-Stuff, a subcategory of Whole-Part.

026 "This experiment is performed with an aqueous solution of a strong <e1>acid</e1> inside a <e2>flask</e2>."
WordNet(e1) = "acid%1:27:00::", WordNet(e2) = "flask%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "acid inside a"

027 "Arthur and Franz are thieves, or they're trying to be thieves, and somehow learn that Odile lives in a <e1>house</e1> that contains a large sum of <e2>money</e2>."
WordNet(e1) = "house%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "money%1:21:01::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "a house that contains a"
Comment: or Located-Location.

028 "A tokamak is a toroidal (doughnut shape) <e1>magnetic bottle</e1> that contains the <e2>fusion plasma</e2>."
WordNet(e1) = "magnetic_bottle%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "plasma%1:26:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "bottle that contains"

029 "A letterbox is a plastic, screw-top <e1>bottle</e1> that contains a small <e2>notebook</e2> and a unique rubber stamp."
WordNet(e1) = "bottle%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "notebook%1:10:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "bottle that contains"

030 "That's because nostalgia serves a useful defensive and reparative function; it took the <e1>sting</e1> from a <e2>painful episode</e2> in his life by shading the script."
WordNet(e1) = "sting%1:26:02::", WordNet(e2) = "episode%1:11:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "took the * from a"
Comment: no relation seems to fit...

031 "It has long been thought that the <e1>crypt</e1> contained the <e2>tomb</e2> of St Paul but the altar had hidden it."
WordNet(e1) = "crypt%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "tomb%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the * contained the"
Comment: both Located-Location and Whole-Part fit.

032 "Flash Drives were designed to be portable - worn on a necklace or key chain - while <e1>diskettes</e1> should be carried in a <e2>case</e2> for protection."
WordNet(e1) = "diskette%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "case%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "carried in a"

033 "The <e1>clutter</e1> in my <e2>house</e2> was destroying me."
WordNet(e1) = "clutter%1:26:00::", WordNet(e2) = "house%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "the * in my house"
Comment: possibly Located-Location.

034 "Because of the Depression the original design was cut back significantly, but the <e1>building</e1> contained a number of unique <e2>architectural features</e2>."
WordNet(e1) = "building%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "feature%1:09:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the building contained"
Comment: Property.

035 "While Calvin is able to get the diamond, he's nearly caught by the police while making his getaway, and stashes the <e1>jewel</e1> in a <e2>bag</e2> carried by a passerby."
WordNet(e1) = "jewel%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "bag%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "the * in a bag"

036 "The <e1>kitchen</e1> holds a <e2>cooker</e2>, fridge, microwave oven, in short; everything you need if you want to prepare a light meal."
WordNet(e1) = "kitchen%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "cooker%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "the kitchen holds"
Comment: a cooker is not attached (only plugged in), and a kitchen without a cooker is possible, so the definition holds.

037 "Let us sprinkle flowers around and put <e1>wine</e1> in the <e2>cup</e2>."
WordNet(e1) = "wine%1:13:00::", WordNet(e2) = "cup%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = n1 "put wine in the"
Comment: the temporal element is at issue. The wine is not, and may never be, in the cup. There is no entailment to justify classifying this example as positive.

038 "The <e1>bulbs</e1> in my <e2>house</e2> use 190 watts."

WordNet(e1) = "stomach%1:08:00::", WordNet(e2) = "acid%1:27:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "to contain acid"
Comment: the best choice, but oddly the definition fails a little (one cannot get rid of acid).

041 "Tapestries of rocky coastlines share wall space with a <e1>clock</e1> inside a ship's <e2>wheel</e2>."
WordNet(e1) = "clock%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "wheel%1:06:01::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "a clock inside a"

WordNet(e1) = "cabinet%1:06:02::", WordNet(e2) = "kitchen%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "the * in my kitchen"
Comment: cabinets are normally affixed, so this is Part-Whole.

WordNet(e1) = "key%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "car%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "the * inside the car"

WordNet(e1) = "air%1:27:00::", WordNet(e2) = "jar%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "in the jar"
Comment: though it is hard to remove air...

049 "If you mount the photo on a <e1>material</e1> that contains <e2>acid</e2> the paper will absorb the acid which in turn will attack the photo itself."

Comment: Located-Location (the sentence does not entail that the room is a kitchen or a bathroom).

076 "The lower portion of the <e1>building</e1> contained hundreds of <e2>storage rooms</e2>."
WordNet(e1) = "building%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "storage_room%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the building contained"

Comment: a boundary case. Shelves support books, rather. Still, the definition of Content-Container holds.

083 "The viewer looks through an <e1>eyehole</e1> in the <e2>metal box</e2> into the abyss, an infinite regression/progression of mirrors reflecting themselves."
WordNet(e1) = "eyehole%1:06:01::", WordNet(e2) = "box%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "in the metal box"

WordNet(e1) = "battery%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "flashlight%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "batteries stored in"
Comment: a small dilemma. Batteries are stored/carried, but they also are part of a functioning flashlight. Still, the sentence entails that the batteries are inside the flashlight, and this is what matters.

087 "The <e1>box</e1> holds three stiff <e2>cardboard tubes</e2>, each wrapped in now decaying cellophane."
WordNet(e1) = "box%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "tube%1:25:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "the box holds"

WordNet(e1) = "jelly%1:27:00::", WordNet(e2) = "fruit%1:11:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "jelly inside a"
Comment: Part-Whole? Note the spelling "passion fruit" in WN -- with a space. The WN sense of e1 (any substance having the consistency of jelly or gelatin) is iffy; the other two are not acceptable.

092 "A <e1>dining room</e1> that contains direct <e2>access</e2> from the kitchen is the most practical, unless the room will exist for fluff purposes only."
WordNet(e1) = "dining_room%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "access%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "room that contains"
Comment: Part-Whole. In WN: access -- a way of entering or leaving ==> any artifact consisting of a path affording passage from one place to another.

WordNet(e1) = "trench%1:06:01::", WordNet(e2) = "yard%1:23:02::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "the * was inside the"

Comment: Located-Location. The sentence and world knowledge entail that hereacid and solution don't mix.

110 "Close all <e1>doors</e1> inside the <e2>house</e2> to slow down fire spread from room to room."
WordNet(e1) = "door%1:06:01::", WordNet(e2) = "house%1:06:01::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "inside the house"

WordNet(e1) = "tea%1:13:00::", WordNet(e2) = "food%1:13:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "put tea in the"
Comment: this cannot be Part-Whole (tea might be part, but food can only be whole after the putting has occurred -- something not entailed by the sentence). It is also not quite Located-Location: putting is not a fact but a possibility. Such temporal uncertainties are tough to interpret.

112 "Now, I have a plastic <e1>bottle</e1> that contains <e2>alcohol</e2> in which I put my artificial eyelashes at night when I take them off, to clean them and keep them safe."

Comment: neither WordNet sense makes sense. Choose your poison.

117 "Like many recipes for stuffing, the original <e1>recipe</e1> contained <e2>apples</e2>, but as apples are a higher carb fruit, I have substituted cranberries which have the dual effect of making the stuffing lower carb than the regular recipe and also adding a little extra seasonal color and flavor."
WordNet(e1) = "recipe%1:10:00::", WordNet(e2) = "apple%1:13:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "the * contained apples"
Comment: apples (direction to use them) are part of a recipe (direction to make something). So, Whole-Part.

118 "I explained that I was a teacher and that the <e1>boxes</e1> contained <e2>books</e2> I was bringing for the students to improve their English."

WordNet(e1) = "information%1:14:00::", WordNet(e2) = "database%1:10:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "the * is kept in the"
Comment: removing some information preserves the nature of the database.

120 "A new <e1>composter</e1> is now available from East Sussex County Council which can be kept in the <e2>kitchen</e2> and will take all organic waste."
WordNet(e1) = "?", WordNet(e2) = "kitchen%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "kept in the kitchen"
Comment: Located-Location would be preferred, but this artefact can be removed from the kitchen with impunity. Note: no WordNet sense.

121 "To repair, use duct tape or caulk to seal <e1>gaps</e1> in the <e2>metal box</e2> and between joints and seams in the duct."
WordNet(e1) = "gap%1:17:00::", WordNet(e2) = "box%1:06:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "false", Query = "in the metal box"
Comment: Part-Whole, if a gap can be a part (compare with holes in objects).

122 "The <e1>kitchen</e1> contains basic items such as <e2>salt</e2>, pepper and olive oil."
WordNet(e1) = "kitchen%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "salt%1:13:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "false", Query = "kitchen contains * such as"

WordNet(e1) = "signal%1:19:00::", WordNet(e2) = "beam%1:19:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "carried in a"
Comment: compare with information/wave. A beam is limited in space (long but narow).

WordNet(e1) = "information%1:10:00::", WordNet(e2) = "wave%1:11:00::", Content-Container(e1, e2) = "true", Query = "carried in a"
Comment: another example of metonymy (waves carry a physical representation of information). A wave is delimited in space, too, even if long (-:).

136 "This is why, not only the contents of the <e1>box</e1> were a <e2>present</e2>, but the box itself was as a present."
WordNet(e1) = "box%1:06:00::", WordNet(e2) = "present%1:21:00::", Content-Container(e2, e1) = "true", Query = "contents of the * were a"

Comment: the sense of e1 might as well be any of the other three. The example is metaphorical: not Content-Container.
