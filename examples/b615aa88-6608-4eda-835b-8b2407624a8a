It was as tumultuous as anticipated, only in a totally different manner than anybody had expected. When Bayern Munich called a Friday press conference with the president Uli Hoeness, chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, coach Niko Kovac and sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, all confirmed to be present, it was clear they wouldn’t just be talking about the forthcoming weekend visit to Wolfsburg and delivering injury news updates.The rumour mill swirled into some weird places. Was Arsène Wenger about to be appointed as coach, notwithstanding the highly unlikely scenario of Kovac being present at his own dethroning? Was Kovac going to be backed, or given a timescale by which things must improve after four winless games? Were we about to hear of a restructuring at the top, above the coach’s head, where the power really lies at Bayern?In the end, Kovac’s was the support act, backing his players to dig the team out of a shallow hole and then stepping aside, with a wry grin on his face, to allow the executive trio to speak. They did so with no little ire, with Rummenigge threatening to make legal representation to any media making “false” reports about the club and its team, calling recent reporting on some of the club’s highest profile players (including Manuel Neuer and Jérôme Boateng) “disrespectful” and “outrageous”, and saying Bayern would “no longer stand for” it.Hoeness went even further, raging about “false facts” and then rather undermining Rummenigge’s argument by singling out a few players for criticism, reiterating his knock of Mesut Özil and complaining about an article that questioned the sale of Juan Bernat to Paris Saint-Germain by saying the left-back had almost “singlehandedly” engineered Champions League elimination last year with a poor performance against Sevilla.So, while a gritty, determined 3-1 win in Lower Saxony on Saturday was just what the doctor ordered, one could forgive a still-half-stunned press pack for having their minds on more than just the game. Hoeness and Rummenigge, who looked happy and relaxed in the stands, declined to add to their comments post-match and Salihamidzic requested the conversation “stick to talking about the game”.The players themselves were tight-lipped, with the usually expressive Mats Hummels asking if journalists could “make it quick” as he exited the dressing room to talk. Only Thomas Müller acknowledged the matter, mischievously teasing the topic. “We talk about it, of course,” he said, “but only with each other.”Müller and Boateng had spent the afternoon on the bench and there was a fresh feel to the team, with the coach at least partially acknowledging the difficulties of his senior players even while continuing to express faith in them. Kovac, perhaps taking his lead from Germany’s improved display in their narrow defeat in France, brought the former Arsenal forward Serge Gnabry into the XI.Perhaps that last week is what got under Hoeness and Rummenigge’s skin so much. An international break would normally be an opportunity for the media spotlight to wander, but Germany and Bayern are as closely bound in their core – and in the public consciousness – as Spain and Barcelona were in their prime. While they were off duty for Bayern, the quintet of Neuer, Boateng, Hummels, Müller and Joshua Kimmich were central protagonists in the hugely disappointing 3-0 reverse in the Netherlands, and were criticised as such.Gnabry was fairly peripheral in what was a fairly assured performance against willing but malleable opponents, in which some senior players stood up in a way they hadn’t for a few weeks. Javi Martínez and James Rodríguez bossed midfield and Robert Lewandowski looked more like his best self. Bayern’s centre-forward hadn’t scored for 315 minutes but his eyes must have lit up on seeing Wolfsburg on the horizon. Lewandowski had scored 16 in 15 previous meetings, and notched another brace here.It wasn’t always plain sailing, with Niklas Süle making a risky last-man challenge on Max Arnold which went unsanctioned and Bayern playing the last 34 minutes of normal time with 10 men after Arjen Robben was sent off for a second bookable offence. When Wout Weghorst pulled one back for Die Wölfe shortly afterwards it looked like they might be in business before Rodríguez wrapped things up, after more great work from Lewandowski.It could never have been, as Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Peter Burghardt put it, “quite as spectacular as the historic press conference”, but it was almost ideal for Bayern’s purposes in the given situation, showing them winning but needing to sweat a little. There was even room for some light relief, with the deeply unedifying sight of Lewandowski and Rodríguez flossing after the third goal.They’re still not imperious, and one wonders if Bruno Labbadia would have dared make such brave changes – throwing on Daniel Ginczek and Admir Mehmedi, switching to a more attacking formation and going for broke – even against 10 men if he had been facing a more imposing version of Bayern. If the purpose of Friday’s address was to make the champions seem less vulnerable, you have to question its value. If and when the next stumble comes, one expects the media contestation will be firm, with Hoeness and Rummenigge’s warnings likely to mirror the scene in Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused when Mitch’s elder sister asks the seniors to go easy on him when administering the initiation licks, thus guaranteeing him a sound beating when they catch up with him.“I’m in charge of the sport side of it,” Kovac reiterated at full time, stepping away from the drama upstairs. If there’s one silver lining for him, it’s that the explosions elsewhere are leaving him to get on with his sizeable job with mercifully little hassle.• Bayern only finish the weekend in fourth after wins for Borussia Mönchengladbach (who beat Mainz 4-0 with a Jonas Hofmann hat-trick) and Werder Bremen (who won 2-0 at Schalke thanks to a superb brace by Maxi Eggestein), “surfing a wave of euphoria” as Kicker put it after their best start in 13 years.• Borussia Dortmund continue unbeaten at the top, giving Markus Weinzierl a nightmare debut as Stuttgart coach, by winning 4-0 at the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Marco Reus, who scored the second, called their first-half display – after which they led by three – “satisfactory”. Paco Alcácer scored again via a sublime chip, as did Jadon Sancho on the day when his fellow Englishman Reiss Nelson hit a brace in Hoffenheim’s come-from-behind win in Nürnberg.• There was no doubt about the weekend’s real hotshot, though, with Luka Jović hitting five in Friday night’s 7-1 demolition of Fortuna Düsseldorf. They were finishes of real quality, underlining why Eintracht Frankfurt’s sporting director, Fredi Bobic, confirmed the club will take up their option on the Benfica loanee permanently “in the near future” – with much media handwringing in Portugal over the speed with which the Lisbon giants ran out of patience with the Serbian forward.Eintracht Frankfurt 7-1 Fortuna Düsseldorf, Bayer Leverkusen 2-2 Hannover, Vfb Stuttgart 0-4 Borussia Dortmund, Augsburg 0-0 RB Leipzig, Wolfsburg 1-3 Bayern Munich, FC Nurnberg 1-3 Hoffenheim, Schalke 0-2 Werder Bremen, Hertha Berlin 1-1 Freiburg, Mönchengladbach 4-0 Mainz
