Real Madrid coach Julen Lopetegui has brushed off media reports that he could soon lose his job saying that there is still time to reverse the team’s fortunes. Lopetegui has been at the helm for nine La Liga games, only four of which ended in victory for the club.‘If you’re wanting to see a wounded coach, don’t look over here,’ the former Spain boss told a news conference before their Champions League tie with Viktoria Plzen on Tuesday. Meanwhile, midfielder Isco was firmly behind his manager, saying the players must take responsibility for the reigning European champions’ slump.Source: SNTV
